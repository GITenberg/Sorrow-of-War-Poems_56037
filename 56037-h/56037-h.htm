  STREETS OF GOLD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  O there are streets of gold in Bethnal Green,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With troughs of pearl where lovely horses drink,<br />
  And tripping on the greenswards, silver-clean,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls are marvellouser than you can think.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gawd blimey!  Bethnal Green!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(All this from Tommy Jones,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delirious in the trench with shattered bones).<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O there is harvest now in Camden Town,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And songs and laughing and old flasks of wine!<br />
  O the grand moon of bronze! the wakeful brown<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl in the barn! ghost-poppies and dream-kine!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor lumme!  Camden Town!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This with the gasp of death<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 'Erbert, chlorine-gassed and green for breath).<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O what green seas sweep winds through Camberwell,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all her islands where the palm-trees heave!<br />
  O winding down the channels steals a bell<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling poor weary lads to bathe at eve!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God blawst it!  Camberwell!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This from old Bob, whose side<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is pierced with wounds like Jesus crucified).<br />

  They are showing how we lie<br />
  With our bodies run dry:<br />
  The attitudes we take<br />
  When impaled upon a stake.<br />
  These and other things they show<br />
  In the gallery where the fat men go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In the gallery where the fat men go<br />
  They're exhibiting our guts<br />
  Horse-betrampled in the ruts;<br />
  And Private Tommy Spout,<br />
  With his eye gouged out;<br />
  And Jimmy spitting blood;<br />
  And Sergeant lying so<br />
  That he's drowning in the mud,<br />
  In the gallery where the fat men go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  They adjust their pince-nez<br />
  In the gentle urban way,<br />
  And they plant their feet tight<br />
  For to get a clearer sight.<br />
  They stand playing with their thumbs,<br />
  With their shaven cheeks aglow.<br />
  For the Terror never comes,<br />
  And the worms and the woe.<br />
  For they never hear the drums<br />
  Drumming Death dead-slow,<br />
  In the gallery where the fat men go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If the gallery where the fat men go<br />
  Were in flames around their feet,<br />
  Or were sucking through the mud:<br />
  If they heard the guns beat<br />
  Like a pulse through the blood:<br />
  If the lice were in their hair,<br />
  And the scabs were on their tongue,<br />
  And the rats were smiling there,<br />
  Padding softly through the dung,<br />
  Would they fix the pince-nez<br />
  In the gentle urban way,<br />
  Would the pictures still be hung<br />
  In the gallery where the fat men go?<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What English flower<br />
  That we cherish shall grow of him?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never a flower<br />
  Shall grow that we know of him!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No white daisy-coverlet<br />
  Shall grow from the ground of him;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No English bird-loverlet<br />
  Pipe love-songs around of him.<br />
  Under the sycamore<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His grave not appears,<br />
  Where the crocuses flicker more<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than armies with spears.<br />
  Under no tree at all<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England designed<br />
  His body may be at all<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently consigned.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died in Gallipoli<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death on a stake.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallipoli poison<br />
  Is now the great part of him.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flower like a snake<br />
  Shall writhe from the heart of him.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desolate surf<br />
  Below him is muttering.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his turf<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bird like a devil<br />
  Is flapping and fluttering.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poisonous bird<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose scarlet eye glowers,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poisonous flowers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With petals unclean<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the only things heard<br />

  You are dead to me, dead to me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barren and far,<br />
  But a Thing that was said to me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a bird, by a star,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;An old thing of solace,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O stupid it seemed;<br />
  And I now cannot tell at all<br />
  If the whisper that fell at all<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard or I dreamed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed that I caught a<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint whisper or sign,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being drunken with water,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hallowed with wine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah, would that I knew<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Word was that came,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Thing was that gleamed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wind and a flame;<br />
  Ah, would that I knew,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as you,<br />
  O white lad from England,<br />
  White lad from England,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead in Gallipoli,<br />
  Would that I knew<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I heard or I dreamed!<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks, where the eagles whose granite bills<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screech from the scars of toppling hills.<br />
  To the South lands, the green lands, from the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North, the marsh<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hollows which black waste water fills,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are moons entangled in cosmic trees,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where birds are rocks in the foam of seas,<br />
  The wind's a player, the grass a lute<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose wires are swept by the wings of bees,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sob of birds in a poisoned wood!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fume of poppies crushed foul in mud!<br />
  The whine of the wings of Death through the dark!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sunset of flame, a moon of blood!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;The South red lands!<br />

  THE NEW TRADE
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  In the market-places they have made<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dolorous new trade.<br />
  Now you will see in the fierce naphtha-light,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piled hideously to sight,<br />
  Dead limbs of men bronzed in the over-seas,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bomb-wrenched from elbows and knees;<br />
  Torn feet, that would, unwearied by harsh loads,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have tramped steep moorland roads;<br />
  Torn hands that would have moulded exquisitely<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rare things for God to see.<br />
  And there are eyes there&mdash;blue like blue doves' wings,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black like the Libyan kings,<br />
  Grey as before-dawn rivers, willow-stirred,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown as a singing-bird;<br />
  But all stare from the dark into the dark,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproachful, tense, and stark.<br />
  Eyes heaped on trays and in broad baskets there,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feet, hands, and ropes of hair.<br />
  In the market-places ... and women buy ...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Naphtha glares ... hawkers cry ...<br />
  Fat men rub hands....<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God, O just God, send<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plague, lightnings ...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make an end!<br />

  THE WOMAN WHO SHRIEKED AGAINST PEACE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Abundant woman panting there,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose breast is flecked with spots of grease<br />

  And shall your flesh grow less to view,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If blinded boys no more shall creep<br />

  THE WOMEN AT THE CORNERS STAND<br />

<p class="poem">
  The women at the corners stand.  They say,<br />
  "Where are the men you stole from us away?<br />
  Where are they now, the laughing lovers whom<br />
  You heaped in sombre ranks against the gloom?"<br />
  They murmur ceaselessly and without haste,<br />
  "Our arms are empty and our wombs are waste."<br />
  "Where are the men that marched into the dusk?"<br />
  They say with voices withered like a husk.<br />
  "Night is like cinders: day is lean and stern.<br />
  Our hearts are parched with thirsting; yea, we burn.<br />
  Where are the men you took?  Bid them return."<br />

<p class="poem">
  The women at the corners stand.  But no<br />
  Reply is heard.  They wait till night.  They go<br />
  Back to their homes.  Once more they come next day,<br />
  "Where are the men you stole from us away?"<br />
  They draw their shawls around their heads.  They wait.<br />
  They say, "But we are weary.  It is late."<br />
  They murmur ceaselessly and without haste,<br />
  "Our arms are empty and our wombs are waste."<br />
  No word is said to them.  But only they,<br />
  The women at the corners, stand.  They say,<br />
  "Send back our lovers whom you stole away."<br />

  SKYLARK AND DAWN
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  (To Maurice Samuel)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Stretched and silent they lie to the furious gold of the dawn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the earth like a leper's face is pitted and scarred.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firm in the grip of the wire relentless and hard,<br />
  They lie with their dead young faces pallid and drawn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Somewhere stupidly, thickly, a big gun booms!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rifle cracks like the spit of a snake in the trees!<br />
  And ever the great sun rises, rolling the glooms<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sulphurous night to the fields and the cliffs and the seas.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The groan of a dying man crawls out from his teeth!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groans no more: his lips become leaden and cold!<br />
  And ever the sun flashes forth like a sword from its sheath,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dazzles the dawn with terrors of scarlet and gold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The guns snarl out like a dog reluctant and grim.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triggers of rifles loosen in blue numb hands.<br />
  Faintly the wings of a silence frightened and dim<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hover down closer over the blasted lands.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods of the great wars,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods that stand<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cruel and grand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence, Silence,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant us to die<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the song of Silence<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gods of the great wars,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas-wave and gun,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are ye not happy<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the red work done?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drown ye the planets,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Not a twitching of bloodless lip or of glazing eye!<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When never a wind breathed over the primal slime.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The Sun is stayed in his march, and even Death<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the flush of triumph mantling his cheeks of gloom,<br />
  He too stands still for an instant and holds his breath.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A million of years passes by in a moment of doom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrible!  Wild!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A skylark shatters the spell,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a music more fiery than hell,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More frail than the laugh of a child!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  His little brown wings soar high to assault the sun.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His little round throat sends a challenge audacious and far<br />
  To the pale-faced legions of Silence that waver and run,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the uprisen dawn and every invisible star.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ah God! the song cuts deeper than tempered steel!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes overflow with the surge of a salt harsh tear,<br />
  Again to listen to Music, again to feel<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uttermost glory of living when Death is so near!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scream of a shell! ...<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull dead thud in a trench,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curses and flame and stench! ...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Instantly all the white dawn,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fragrant and frail and cool,<br />
  Breaks like a vase in the hands of a fool.<br />
  For the thick sick lips of Death have spoken,<br />
  The fine gold chain of the bird-song is broken.<br />
  The lank dank hand of Death has withdrawn<br />
  The curtain of bird-song and magic dawn<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sullen red windows of Hell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Rattle of rifle and shriek of gun,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas-cloud sickly and heavy and dun,<br />
  Death has taken his armies in hand,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bodies lie countless in No Man's Land.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something drops down at my feet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little brown body and sweet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little dead body and warm.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The tiny dead throat shall sing no more,<br />
  Nor the quick eyes flash nor the swift wings soar;<br />
  But the shells shall hurtle, the grim guns roar,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O skylark out of the sky!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My singing is ended, the pall descended on land and sea.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sang my song to the tune of my own heart-beat<br />
  Between the sound of the wars, and there sang with me<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My little brother the skylark, dead at my feet.<br />

  JACK OF APRIL<br />

<p class="poem">
  April!&mdash;this is when<br />
  All the flowers beloved of men,<br />
  This is when they laugh all day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds and they.<br />
  Then are they not opened quite<br />
  To the singing year's delight.<br />
  This is when the April showers<br />
  Make a running road of noise;<br />
  Woods are stormed by boyish flowers,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowery boys.<br />
  Would you then not weep with me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wring your hands,<br />
  Sing a dirge of saddest grief,<br />
  If your eyes should chance to see<br />
  Blight upon the April leaf;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, but more,<br />
  Would you not weep long and sore,<br />
  If an April flower that stands<br />
  Waiting for the kiss of May,<br />
  Suddenly, swift, were snapt away,<br />
  Down, deep down, were crushed in clay?<br />
  Then would you not almost say,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Curst be April!<br />
  Never sunlight bring in May!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curst be June!<br />
  Death hath seized the budding year.<br />
  Never flush of copper stir<br />
  On the unrisen harvest moon!<br />
  May stark winter come straightway<br />

  There are flowers to learn, he said,<br />
  In the countries where I go.<br />
  There are birds to talk to and<br />
  Skies and winds to understand.<br />
  Never a moment knew he pause.<br />
  Jack went swinging to the ships<br />
  With a laughter on his lips,<br />
  Jack went singing to the wars.<br />
  Jack among the boys and men<br />
  Went to France in April when<br />
  Flowers and boys laughed all the day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birds and they.<br />
  ... Till the Doom came down that day,<br />
  Even though the time was Spring,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even April,<br />

  Clay upon his trodden clay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April, Spring!<br />
  April!&mdash;can you wonder then<br />
  That my bitten lips have said,<br />

  Now that Jack in lyric April,<br />

  Never May-time come, nor summer;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never autumn<br />
  Crown the dim uncertain ending<br />
  To the fevers of the race<br />
  With a drowsy peace descending<br />
  On their spirits racked and rending,<br />
  On the evil human face.<br />
  May the last supernal winter<br />
  Freeze the earth straightway,<br />
  Now my little Jack of April,<br />

  A THOUGHT<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  To-night a thought leapt in my head like flame.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose one night I walked into my room<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And found that someone filling all the gloom<br />
  Was waiting on my bed until I came;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And I walked in and switched the light on straight,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And found the figure sitting on my bed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limp with contrition and with sunken head,<br />
  Was God bowed down under His burden's weight;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And He looked up with sorrow and surmise<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see how deep the tale the Wars have written<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay on my mortal features, battle-smitten,<br />
  And in the shadows of my deathless eyes;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &mdash;This was the thought and flame that pierced me through:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If God sat waiting there, anxious and grey,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then should I have the charity to say,<br />
  "God, we forgive you; you know not what you do"?<br />

<h3>
  THE VINTNER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The War-God now is happy.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sunken eyeballs shine.<br />
  The War-God is a Vintner<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who makes the rarest wine.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  His vineyard is not bounded<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the West and East.<br />
  A thousand mothers hourly<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow pregnant for his feast.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The grapes the Vintner presses<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below his granite feet<br />
  Are bodies, bodies, bodies,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive and brown and sweet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O how the red juice splashes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around his pounding limbs!<br />
  It stains the deepest rivers,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furthest sunset rims.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O how the Gods his comrades,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he, the Vintner, calls,<br />
  Drain deep the lurid beakers<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their carousal halls!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All night they hold red riot,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this is wine indeed!<br />
  Then bravo! merry Vintner,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish thy work good speed!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And still the Vintner presses<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grapes with feet of stone,<br />
  Until the deep green ocean-cup<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall hold red wine alone.<br />

  For now comes Summer with a thousand birds.<br />
  And I must add up figures all the day.<br />
  And I must drive a tram the whole day long.<br />
  And I must make a living out of words.<br />
  For now comes Summer with a thousand birds;<br />

  Brown birds will lift so loud a storm of song,<br />
  For now comes Summer with a thousand birds.<br />

  For now comes Summer with a thousand birds.<br />

  My brother's lying quiet on his face.<br />

  A thunder was heard like the cracking of suns,<br />
  A blackness blacker than blood there came<br />
  To choke the world with a fume and a flame.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A palsy fell on the guns.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A numbness froze the hands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the gunners in all the lands.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-way over the parapet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limbs of the climbing infantry set<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like limbs of basalt-stone.<br />
  The bayonets fell from the fingers numb,<br />
  The throats of the officers dried dead-dumb,<br />
  For the Terror had come, the Terror had come,<br />
  The Terror out of the stark Unknown!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow was fallen upon the wars<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had raged three centuries long<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shatter the Lie and Wrong,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ice-fanged polar jaws,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a lull nor pause,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the Temperate Zone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a moment's rest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the Burning Line,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With never a halting sign,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the East and West,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down to the ultimate mouth<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the white Antarctic South.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the torpid Esquimo-man<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slew his Esquimo-mate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poured his fat in a plate,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lit up a wick therein,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And studied the secret plan<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the poisonous new harpoon.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith he was going to win<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esquimo-battle soon.<br />
  From the Esquimo-man to the sinister black<br />
  Cannibal-boy in his skeleton-shack,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose ardent patriot labours<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were extracting the eyes of his foes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones of their fingers and toes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To teach them never to violate<br />

  ATHENS NOW<br />

<p class="poem">
  Behold Athens!  What is Athens now?<br />
  Cinders and weeds where the eyeballs were, filth for<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the marble brow.<br />
  Ilissus, Ilissus of the plain?<br />
  &mdash;Sardine-tins and a dead cat in a drain!<br />
  Dead, dead, dead are the Caryatids<br />
  Because of the horror that smote their petal-thin lids.<br />
  And the Parthenon now is a jawful of yellow teeth<br />
  In the snarling skull of an animal humped in death.<br />
  For Athens is only a squalor of traders that hope<br />
  To retire on the profits from soap.<br />
  And the trousers of half of the children of Pallas are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dirty with grease,<br />
  And the other half ardently brush them and keep them<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in crease.<br />
  Then pray, O London, my city, when you are dead,<br />
  That none know the place where you reared your mad proud head;<br />
  That there be not a mound nor a stone nor even a tree,<br />
  But only the ignorant river or the desert sea!<br />

  Down Tottenham Court Road they ululate,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The droning choruses of Fate.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walk the length of every wind,<br />
  The women who sin, the women who have sinned.<br />
  This evening's crime, all immemorial crimes,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here gather from all lands and times.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here with Orestes through the mart<br />
  Walks the grey lad who stabbed his mother's heart.<br />
  Gaunt Clytæmnestra stumbles round the feet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Sarah from a Soho street,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slew her sallow man to-night<br />
  With thin-lipped poison in the street lamp-light.<br />
  Pale Helen braids her legendary hair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lurking outside a gallery-stair,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While softly through the music calls<br />
  Aspasia to her lover in the stalls.<br />
  Here broken Orpheus searches, drunken-wild,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eurydice, the fallen child,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, leagues down in the underworld,<br />
  Flaunts her white bosom, rouged lips, and gilt hair curled.<br />
  Behind the plate-glass windows drum the looms<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Destinies spinning antique dooms.<br />

  Like a drab slut, and stares and stinks.<br />

  The fumes, the squalors dissipate.<br />

  Into the darkness like a knife;<br />

  Hungry for love, half-dumb with hate,<br />
  Intense with death and sick for life,<br />
  &mdash;Into the darkness like a knife!<br />

  LIZA<br />

<p class="poem">
  Liza sits on a three-legged stool all day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beneath the railway-stairs.<br />
  (Liza is a shadowy woman selling shadowy wares.)<br />
  The boots that Liza wears to-day were worn<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a score of years ago<br />
  By Dick the tramp who threw them away as<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far as ever he could throw.<br />
  The petticoats that Liza wears around her<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limbs of sticks and skin<br />
  Were thrown aside with tall disdain into a<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back-street rubbish bin.<br />
  But O the bonnet that Liza wears, it is the<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summit of her pride;<br />
  A big limp feather hangs over her nose and<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two more hang on either side.<br />
  There's no more stately woman than Liza,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be she the sought of a score of kings.<br />
  (Liza is a shadowy woman, selling shadowy things.)<br />
  All day long she sits upright, waiting upon<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her three-legged stool,<br />
  Until the hosts of little children come tumbling<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homeward out of school.<br />
  Then Liza shows her wooden tray whenever<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children meet her eye.<br />
  "Come along, babies, only a kiss for any<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little dainty you may buy.<br />
  Purple figs from a Grecian garden, pomegranate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blossoms blazing red.<br />
  Jangle bells of langling silver to wrangle<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around of a wee girl's head."<br />
  Liza's fingers twitch and tighten, her deep-down<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes they are flecked and starred.<br />
  But her voice is like a moan in a rifted chimney<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you can only hear it if you listen very hard.<br />
  Never the little children hear, they toddle<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homeward day by day.<br />
  &mdash;Who would look at a bogey-woman whispering<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over an empty tray?<br />
  Ironically floats the bobbing feather over<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liza's hungry eye.<br />
  "Isn't there just one wee little baby to come<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to my face and kiss and buy?"<br />
  ... All day long and all year round she<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waits, but no one pays her price.<br />

  On the drab flags squat children dusty-eyed,<br />

  Just down the street there sprawls a suicide.<br />

  There is a time of charm and chime,<br />

  There is a place of dear content,<br />

  This is the time and this the place<br />
  Where boughs droop down with dews of grace;<br />
  Where under hedges hung with sleep,<br />
  Through atmospheres of music creep<br />
  Sheep like ghosts and ghosts like sheep.<br />
  Here a great Lord of Magic comes<br />
  Fanfarronading with far drums,<br />
  And deep athwart the night he throws<br />
  His banners of white fire and rose.<br />
  From the great town unto the sea,<br />
  He thunders through his empiry.<br />
  But when his drums are heard no more,<br />
  The quiet is quiet as before.<br />
  And there's a drowsy dreamy scent<br />
  Drenches the midmost field in Kent.<br />
  Neither more quickly nor more slow,<br />
  Shadows come, shadows go.<br />
  Shadows that reap while others sow,<br />
  Shadows that sow while others reap,<br />
  Shadows whose windy singings keep,<br />
  Sheep like ghosts and ghosts like sheep.<br />

  The old friends hover nigher<br />
  In simple shepherd dreams.<br />

  The changing of the hour.<br />
  But the shepherd hears the bells<br />
  No other man may hear.<br />

  A look's within his eyes<br />

  Beneath the ancient moon.<br />

  I dream'd I died.<br />
  The green of Spring was not yet manifest<br />
  Upon the cold hillside.<br />
  They bore me slowly to my place of rest,<br />
  And let me bide.<br />
  Far from the pale I lay of space and light,<br />
  Of dusk and dawn.<br />
  I knew the sharp stars of the winter night<br />
  Were far withdrawn.<br />
  Silent I lay upon my bed,<br />
  In sooth at rest.<br />
  The earth pressed heavily on my head,<br />
  My lean hands cross'd my breast.<br />
  I saw not through my eyes.<br />
  When I had faded from the room of sighs,<br />
  Someone had sealed them down with clay,<br />
  Had whispered, "He hath seen the whole<br />
  Of summer earth and starlit skies,<br />
  Or yellow hills of tumbled hay<br />
  That he shall see.<br />
  Here till the time of Judgment let him be.<br />
  God soothe his soul."<br />

  Until I wearied me of dreaming<br />
  And closed the windows of my soul,<br />
  Where no sun streaming<br />
  Show'd how God's far far days did westward roll.<br />
  All blind, blind,<br />
  A sea of sleep did drown me unconfin'd,<br />
  Wide and deep,<br />
  A sea of utter sleep,<br />
  Its levels no time stirred by any wind.<br />
  And so I slept,<br />
  My hands across my breast.<br />
  My clamped spirit kept<br />
  A total rest.<br />

  Of king-cup blooms.<br />
  And when Dawn came,<br />
  Three times I knocked upon the door<br />
  Which was my seal, my world and sky,<br />
  Three times with might.<br />
  There came a burst of sound and light,<br />
  A knowledge broad and deep and high,<br />
  The long breath of a sloping moor.<br />
  I looked into the daylight wide,<br />
  A bird sang thro' the singing blue,<br />
  And then, O heart, and then I knew<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, still, the scarlet sorrel gleams<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All noon along the noon-gold streams.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, still, the meadow-pippet's feet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are dewed on meadow-sweet.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Be curst, O callous flowers that come so fair<br />

Produced by Al Haines
Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
